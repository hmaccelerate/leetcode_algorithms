## [ Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/solution/)

### Analysis

In my approach, I am going to use dp to divide this into subproblems

And that there are `text1.length() * text2.length()` such possible subproblems, we can iterate through the subproblems, starting from the smallest ones, and storing the answer for each. When we get to the larger subproblems, the smaller ones that they depend on will already have been solved. The best way to do this is to use a 2D array.

 Each cell In 2D array represents one subproblem.

there were two cases for subproblems

1. The first letter of each string is the same.
2. The first letter of each string is different.

For the first case, we solve the subproblem that removes the first letter from each, and add `1`. In the grid, this subproblem is always the diagonal immediately down and right.

For the second case, we consider the subproblem that removes the first letter off the first word, and then the subproblem that removes the first letter off the second word. In the grid, these are subproblems immediately right and below.

Putting this all together, we iterate over each column.

- Data structure: Matrix

- Complexity Analysis

  - Time complexity : O*(*M*⋅*N*).

    We're solving  M*⋅*N subproblems. Solving each subproblem is an O(1)*O*(1) operation.

  - Space complexity : O*(*M*⋅*N).

    We'e allocating a 2D array of size M \cdot N*M*⋅*N* to save the answers to subproblems.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        char[] t1=text1.toCharArray();
        char[] t2=text2.toCharArray();
        int length1=t1.length;
        int length2=t2.length;
        int[][] dp=new int[length1+1][length2+1];
        for(int i=1;i<length1+1;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<length2+1;j++){
                if(t1[i-1]==t2[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+1;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j]=Math.max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[length1][length2];
    }
}
```

## [\221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)

### Analysis

I am going to use dp. 

First, We initialize another matrix (dp) with the same dimensions as the original one initialized with all 0’s.

dp(i,j) represents the side length of the maximum square whose bottom right corner is the cell with index (i,j) in the original matrix.

Starting from index (0,0), for every 1 found in the original matrix, we update the value of the current element as

\text{dp}(i, j) = \min \big( \text{dp}(i-1, j), \text{dp}(i-1, j-1), \text{dp}(i, j-1) \big) + 1.dp(*i*,*j*)=min(dp(*i*−1,*j*),dp(*i*−1,*j*−1),dp(*i*,*j*−1))+1.

We also remember the size of the largest square found so far. In this way, we traverse the original matrix once and find out the required maximum size. This gives the side length of the square (say maxsqlen*m**a**x**s**q**l**e**n*). The required result is the area maxsqlen^2*m**a**x**s**q**l**e**n*2.

### Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.length, cols = rows > 0 ? matrix[0].length : 0;
        int[][] dp = new int[rows + 1][cols + 1];
        int maxsqlen = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= cols; j++) {
                if (matrix[i-1][j-1] == '1'){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1;
                    maxsqlen = Math.max(maxsqlen, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxsqlen * maxsqlen;
    }
}

## [\72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

### Analysis

In my approach, I am going to use dp to divide this into subproblems

First, I will create a matrix called d.  Each cell In 2D array represents one subproblem.

 an edit distance `D[i][j]` is an edit distance between the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`.

There are 4 cases. If the last character is the same, `D[i][j]`=`D[i]-1[j-1]`

If not same, we will have 3 operations. In replace , `D[i][j]`=`D[i-1][j-1]`+1. In add, `D[i][j]`=`D[i][j-1]`+1.  In delete, `D[i][j]`=`D[i-1][j]`+1





- Data structure: Matrix
- Complexity Analysis
  - Time complexity : O(m n) as it follows quite straightforward for the inserted loops.
  - Space complexity :O(m n)since at each step we keep the results of all previous computations.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int n= word1.length();
        int m=word2.length();
        if(n*m==0) return n+m;
        int [][] d=new int[n+1][m+1];
        for(int i=0;i<n+1;i++){
            d[i][0]=i;
        }
        for(int j=0;j<m+1;j++){
            d[0][j]=j;
        }
        
        for(int i=1;i<n+1;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<m+1;j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i-1)==word2.charAt(j-1)){
                    d[i][j]=d[i-1][j-1];
                }else{
                    d[i][j]=Math.min(Math.min(d[i-1][j-1]+1,d[i][j-1]+1),d[i-1][j]+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return d[n][m];
    }
