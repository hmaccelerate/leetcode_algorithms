## [\647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

### Analysis

My solution is to find all the centers of  palindromic and then For each center, let's count all the palindromes that have this center. Let `N` be the length of the string. The center of the palindrome could be in one of `2N - 1` positions: either at letter or between two letters.

For each possible palindrome center, let's expand our candidate palindrome on the interval[a,b]. 

- Data structure
- Complexity Analysis
  - Time Complexity: O*(*N*2) where N is the length of `S`. Each expansion might do O(N)*O*(*N*) work.
  - Space Complexity: O*(1).

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String S) {
        int N = S.length(), ans = 0;
        for (int center = 0; center <= 2*N-1; ++center) {
            int left = center / 2;
            int right = left + center % 2;
            while (left >= 0 && right < N && S.charAt(left) == S.charAt(right)) {
                ans++;
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
